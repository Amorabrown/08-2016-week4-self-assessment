# Debug Transform

We built `transform` but it does not work. Why? Debugging time! You are tasked with walking through the code, finding/fixing possible errors and correcting anything that does not follow engineering best practices.

Please do this problem without referring back to exactly how we built transform in previous sprints/slides.

* [ ] Build `loop` (or copy what you wrote in the Extend Obj prompt to define loop here).

var loop = function (collection, callback){
	if (typeOf collection === "object") {
		for (var key in Jon) {
			callback (collection[key], key)
		}
	}
}

* [ ] Debug `transform`.

* [ ] Test your `transform` function using the test case given.
